AltDrag
Made by Stefan Sundin

Drag windows with the mouse when pressing the alt key.
You can use the middle or right mouse button to resize windows.
If you press the shift key while you drag or resize, the window will snap to other windows.
AltDrag will mimic Windows 7 Aero Snap behavior (even if you don't run Windows 7).
Double-click windows to maximize them.

You can edit more settings in AltDrag.ini:
* Enable AutoFocus to bring windows to the front when dragging them.
* Enable AutoSnap to make windows always snap without needing to press shift.
* Enable HookWindows to be able to use the shift key when moving windows without AltDrag.
* Enable InactiveScroll to be to scroll inactive windows with the mouse wheel.
* Configure mouse buttons. The additional actions are: Minimize, AlwaysOnTop, Center and Close.
* Edit the blacklist, a list where you can specify windows that shouldn't be dragged.

A more thorough explanation of AltDrag is available on the website.

If you experience lag when you move or resize windows, try disabling the mouse cursor in AltDrag.ini.
AltDrag will automatically check for updates. You can disable this in AltDrag.ini.

Changelog
---------
1.0:
Added configuration GUI.
Added ability to scroll through windows with the scrollwheel (like Alt+Tab!).
You can now press escape to stop AltDrag. Useful if AltDrag gets in a weird state.

0.9 - 2011-02-01:
Added Aero option. Alt-drag windows to the left, right and top side of the screen. Corners work too!
Added AutoFocus and AutoRemaximize options.
Added InactiveScroll. Enable it to scroll inactive windows.
Added new mouse actions: AlwaysOnTop and Close.
It is now possible to toggle the maximized state with a resize button while dragging.
Replaced roll-up behavior with Aero behavior.
Renamed "stick" to "snap" as people seem to "get" that term better.
Fixed some bugs that prevented HookWindows from working properly.
Tweaked the blacklist (see wiki).

0.8 - 2009-11-15:
Added AutoStick, enable it to make windows always stick without needing to press shift. This replaces StickyScreen.
Renamed ExperimentalFeatures to HookWindows, also improved it so resizing is now supported and windows should no longer flicker. 64-bit programs also work now. I no longer consider it experimental!
The alt key will no longer activate the window menu!
Added the ability to configure what keys should trigger the dragging, resizing, etc.
Added the ability to configure what the mouse buttons do. New actions: minimize and center.
Improved multi-monitor support a lot.
Tweaked the blacklist (see wiki).

0.7 - 2009-04-24:
Added StickyScreen which makes windows automatically stick to the screen borders without needing shift (off by default).
Added the ability to roll-up windows by double-clicking with the middle mouse button.
Fixed some bugs in ExperimentalFeatures, it's working pretty well now so give it a try.
Fixed an annoying error message that sometimes popped up when AltDrag was on autostart.

0.6 - 2009-02-12:
Sticky behavior now works with resize (except when resizing in all directions).
Fixed tray not being hidden by -hide.
Fixed mouse cursor not changing when Aero was disabled in Vista.
Language can now be changed in AltDrag.ini.

0.5 - 2009-01-12:
You can now resize windows with the middle or right mouse button.
You can now double-click a window to maximize it.
You can now blacklist certain windows from being dragged and certain windows from being sticked to.
Blacklisted by default: the alt+tab window in Vista.
Sticky-blacklisted by default: the Vista start menu orb.
The mouse cursor will now change when you move and resize windows.
Only one instance of AltDrag can now be run. Starting AltDrag again will make the first copy add its tray icon.
Experimental feature disabled by default: you can now press the shift key while normally moving windows (dragging the titlebar) to make them stick. Doesn't work with 64-bit processes.

0.4 - 2008-09-14:
You can now press the shift key to make the window stick to other windows.

0.3 - 2008-08-03:
Fixed a bug that made AltDrag ignore all windows which were at the screen borders since it thought they were fullscreen windows.
Improved performance by only installing the mouse hook when the alt key is pressed.

0.2 - 2008-08-01:
You can no longer drag fullscreen windows.
The window is better placed when it's restored from its maximized state.

AltDrag
Made by Stefan Sundin

Drag windows with the mouse when pressing the alt key.
You can use the middle mouse button to resize windows.
If you press the shift key when you move or resize, the window will stick to other windows.
You can use the shift key when normally moving and resizing windows as well.

Fullscreen windows, such as games, will not be dragged or resized.

You can use -hide as a parameter to hide the tray icon.

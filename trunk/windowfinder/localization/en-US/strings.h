Find window's title and classname for use in AltDrag's blacklist. \
Click the tray icon and then click the window you want to blacklist. \
A popup will appear with information about that window. \
For more tricky windows, use the delayed find.\n\
\n\
Note that you can't blacklist windows in AltDrag by using the child or component information!\n\

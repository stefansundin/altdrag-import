Find window's title and classname for use in AltDrag's blacklist.\n\
Click the tray icon and then click the window you want to blacklist.\n\
A popup will appear with information about that window, the title and class.\n\
For more tricky windows, use the delayed find. It will give you three seconds to bring up the window.\n\

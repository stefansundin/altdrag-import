= Introduction =

In addition to simply dragging windows, you can double-click a window to maximize it. You can double-click with the right mouse button to roll-up windows.

If you still have troubles understanding how AltDrag works, you can watch [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22OaiP_HPXY this short video] that one of my users have posted to YouTube.

== Resize ==

You can use either the middle or right mouse button to resize windows. Think of the window as if it is divided into nine squares, and depending on where you press, you will resize the nearest corner.

= Configuration =

There are more features that you can configure in the configuration file called `AltDrag.ini`. The simplest way to open it is through the tray menu.

== Blacklist ==

The first two options you will see are the blacklists, which lets you disable AltDrag from affecting some windows. This is a pretty advanced option and even has [Blacklist its own wiki page]. I recommend you to skip this option until you have learned more about AltDrag.

== Cursor ==

The `Cursor` option gives you a way to disable the cursor change when you drag windows. This option exists purely for performance reasons. You should have it enabled unless dragging windows lags for you.

== AutoStick ==

As explained earlier, you can use the shift key to make the window you are dragging attach itself to other windows. A nifty extension to this is the option `AutoStick`, which will make AltDrag do this by default.

There are three different levels to this option:
  * *1*: Automatically stick windows to the screen borders and the taskbar.
  * *2*: Also automatically stick windows to the outside of all other windows.
  * *3*: Also automatically stick windows to the inside of all other windows.

== HookWindows ==

You can enable an option called `HookWindows` which enables you to use the shift key when you are normally moving windows.

If you enable both `HookWindows` and `AutoStick` then your windows will automatically stick to each other when you drag them normally. This works really well and will likely surprise your friends. :-)

*Note*: There is a bug in 0.8 with `HookWindows`. To make it work, you must press shift *before* you start moving the window. This will be fixed in the next version. Sorry the bug slipped through!

== Language ==

This settings lets you change the language of AltDrag. You can currently choose between English, Spanish, Galician, Korean and Russian.

If you want to translate AltDrag, feel free to email me, but please only do this if you want to commit to keeping your translation up to date in the future.


== Keyboard ==

Here you can configure what keys should trigger the alt-dragging. There is [Keys a separate wiki page] about this where you can read more.


== Mouse ==

In this section you can configure what the mouse buttons do. You can re-arrange them however you'd like, and even use mouse 4 and mouse 5 which doesn't do anything by default.

The mouse actions that exists now are `Move`, `Resize`, `Minimize`, `Center` and `Nothing`. Two mouse actions that are planned for version 0.9 are `AlwaysOnTop` and `Close`.

If you have a great idea for a new mouse action, then send me an email.


== Update ==

AltDrag will by default check if there is a newer version available when it is started. It will only notify you if it finds a new version, it will not download anything for you. If you do not like this behavior, you can disable it here. You have to restart AltDrag to force a new check.

Remember that you can monitor [http://altdrag.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/feed.xml the rss feed] for new releases.

= More =

Now, give AltDrag a try. Most of the features will make sense after you have tried them out.

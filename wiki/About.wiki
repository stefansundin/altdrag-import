= Introduction =
In addition to simply dragging windows, you can double-click a window to maximize it.

While dragging a window, you can press the shift key to make the window snap to other windows.

If you still have troubles understanding how AltDrag works, you can watch [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22OaiP_HPXY this short video] that a user has posted to YouTube.

== Resize ==
You can use either the middle or right mouse button to resize windows. Imagine the window divided into nine squares, and you will resize the corner nearest to where you press.

= Configuration =
Since 1.0, AltDrag has a configuration GUI. The simplest way to open it is by double-clicking the tray icon. The settings are saved in a file called `AltDrag.ini`.

== Language ==
You can currently choose between English, Spanish, Galician and Chinese. I used to offer translations for Russian and Korean, but they have been discontinued because they are out of date.

Do you want to translate AltDrag? Read how to do that [http://code.google.com/p/altdrag/wiki/Translate here].


== Mouse and keyboard ==
You can reconfigure what the mouse buttons do here. The actions that you can choose from are `Move`, `Resize`, `Minimize`, `AlwaysOnTop`, `Center`, `Close` and `Nothing`.

If you have a great idea for a new mouse action, put in a request in the [http://code.google.com/p/altdrag/issues/list issue tracker].


== Blacklist ==
There are three blacklists in AltDrag. They let you disable AltDrag from affecting some windows. This is a pretty advanced option and even has [Blacklist its own wiki page]. I recommend you to skip this option until you have learned more about AltDrag.


== Performance ==
If you open the ini file, you can configure a few settings related to performance.

First there is the `Cursor` option which disables the mouse cursor from changing shape during dragging and resizing.

Then there are `MoveRate` and `ResizeRate` which controls how often the window is redrawn during move and resize. Increase the values to make AltDrag redraw the window less often. Set these values to `1` to make AltDrag use pre-1.0 behavior.


== Updates ==
AltDrag will by default check if there is a newer version available when it is started. It will only notify you if it finds a new version, it will not download anything for you. You can disable this behavior if you don't like it. You can check for update manually in the tray menu, regardless of this setting.

Remember that you can monitor [http://altdrag.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/feed.xml the rss feed] for new releases.


= Other tricks =
There is a hidden setting in Windows that allows for window activation on mouse hovering. This setting is first exposed in the control panel in Windows 7. For previous Windows versions you have to use the [http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-xp TweakUI utility] and enable the "X-Mouse" setting. You can find out what registry settings does this [http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/06/02/10170483.aspx here].

If you, like me, dislike the ability in Windows 7 to shake a window to minimize all other windows, then you can disable it with the following registry hack. Create the DWORD value `NoWindowMinimizingShortcuts` in `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows` and give it the value `1`. Log off and in for the change to take effect.


= UAC =

AltDrag does not require administrator privileges. The only case it needs administrator privileges is when you are trying to drag an elevated program. If you installed AltDrag in `C:\Program Files\`, then you need administrator privileges to edit `AltDrag.ini`. The easiest way to fix this is by right clicking on `AltDrag.ini`, click _Properties_, then go to the _Security_ tab and give the _Users_ group _Full control_ to the file.

If you want AltDrag to launch with administrator privileges on startup, then you have to configure the task scheduler to launch AltDrag on log in. Read [http://botsikas.blogspot.com/2010/05/autostart-application-that-requires-uac.html this blog post] for a tutorial. There is one caveat though, you need to configure *a delay of 30 seconds* before the task is started. Otherwise the tray icon won't be added properly and AltDrag will not work. You must also disable the autostart option in the tray menu. Successfully configuring a task like this will allow AltDrag to be launched on startup with administrator privileges without a UAC prompt.


= Reporting bugs and suggesting new features =

You should report bugs and suggest new features in [http://code.google.com/p/altdrag/issues/list the issue tracker]. If you send them by email I might forget them.

When suggesting new features, just keep this in mind; I *don't* want AltDrag to become this:

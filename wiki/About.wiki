= Introduction =

In addition to simply dragging windows, you can double-click a window to maximize it.

When dragging a window, you can press the shift key to make it snap to the edges of other windows.

If you still have troubles understanding how AltDrag works, you can watch [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22OaiP_HPXY this short video] that one of my users have posted to YouTube.


== Resize ==

You can use either the middle or right mouse button to resize windows. Think of the window as if it is divided into nine squares, and depending on where you press, you will resize the nearest corner.

= Configuration =

There are more features that you can configure in the configuration file called `AltDrag.ini`. The simplest way to open it is through the tray menu.


== `[AltDrag]` ==

These settings affect general AltDrag behavior.

==== AutoFocus ====
 Automatically raise and focus the windows you drag.

==== AutoSnap ====
 As explained earlier, you can use the shift key to make the window you are dragging attach itself to other windows. A nifty extension to this is the option `AutoSnap`, which will make AltDrag do this by default.

 List of settings:
  * *0*: Disabled.
  * *1*: Automatically snap to the screen borders and the taskbar.
  * *2*: Also automatically snap to the outside of all other windows.
  * *3*: Also automatically snap to the inside of all other windows.

==== AutoRemaximize ====
 Automatically re-maximize windows when you move them between monitors.

==== Aero ====
 Make AltDrag mimic the Windows 7 Aero Snap behavior. Drag windows to the left, right or top side of the monitor. Corners work too!

 This works great even with Windows XP and with multiple monitors.

==== InactiveScroll ====
 Enable this option to be able to scroll inactive windows.

==== HookWindows ====
 You can enable an option called `HookWindows` which enables you to use the shift key when you are normally moving windows.

 If you enable both `HookWindows` and `AutoSnap` then your windows will automatically snap to each other when you drag them normally. This works really well and will likely surprise your friends. :-)

==== Language ====
 This settings lets you change the language of AltDrag. You can currently choose between English, Spanish and Galician. I used to offer translations for Russian and Korean, but they have been discontinued because they are out of date.

 If you want to translate AltDrag, feel free to email me, but please only do this if you want to commit to keeping your translation up to date in the future.


== `[Blacklist]` ==
Here you will see the blacklists. They let you disable AltDrag from affecting some windows. This is a pretty advanced option and even has [Blacklist its own wiki page]. I recommend you to skip this option until you have learned more about AltDrag.


== `[Performance]` ==
The `Cursor` option gives you a way to disable the cursor change that happens during drag/resize. This option exists purely for performance reasons. You should have it enabled unless dragging windows lags for you.


== `[Keyboard]` ==
Here you can configure what keys should trigger the alt-dragging. There is [Hotkeys a separate wiki page] about this where you can read more.


== `[Mouse]` ==
In this section you can configure what the mouse buttons do. You can re-arrange them however you'd like, and even use mouse 4 and mouse 5 which doesn't do anything by default.

The actions that exists now are `Move`, `Resize`, `Minimize`, `AlwaysOnTop`, `Center`, `Close` and `Nothing`.

If you have a great idea for a new mouse action, then send me an email.


== `[Update]` ==
AltDrag will by default check if there is a newer version available when it is started. It will only notify you if it finds a new version, it will not download anything for you. If you do not like this behavior, you can disable it here. You can check for update manually in the tray menu, regardless of this setting. 

Remember that you can monitor [http://altdrag.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/feed.xml the rss feed] for new releases.


= Other tricks =
There is a hidden setting in Windows that allows for window activation on mouse hovering. This setting is first exposed in the control panel in Windows 7. For previous Windows versions you have to use the [http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-xp TweakUI utility] and enable the "X-Mouse" setting. You can find out what registry settings that does this [http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/06/02/10170483.aspx here]. I expect to add functionality in a later version so you can configure this in AltDrag.


= UAC =

AltDrag does not require administrator privileges. The only case it needs administrator privileges is when you are trying to drag an elevated program. If you installed AltDrag in `C:\Program Files\`, then you need administrator privileges to edit `AltDrag.ini`. The easiest way to fix this is by right clicking on `AltDrag.ini`, click _Properties_, then go to the _Security_ tab and give the _Users_ group _Full control_ to the file.

If you want AltDrag to launch with administrator privileges on startup, then you have to configure the task scheduler to launch AltDrag on log in. Read [http://botsikas.blogspot.com/2010/05/autostart-application-that-requires-uac.html this blog post] for a tutorial. There is one caveat though, you need to configure *a delay of 30 seconds* before the task is started. Otherwise the tray icon won't be added properly and AltDrag will not work. You must also disable the autostart option in the tray menu. Successfully configuring a task like this will allow AltDrag to be launched on startup with administrator privileges without a UAC prompt.


= Reporting bugs and suggesting new features =

You should report bugs and suggest new features in [http://code.google.com/p/altdrag/issues/list the issue tracker]. If you send them by email I might forget them.

When suggesting new features, just keep this in mind; I *don't* want AltDrag to become this:

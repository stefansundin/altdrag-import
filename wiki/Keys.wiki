= Introduction =

Configuring the `Keys` option in the ini file is not that easy as it might seem like. Since I am a bit lazy, and still want you to be able to configure whatever key you want, I simply let you specify the hex values that represent the keys on the keyboard.

You can find hex values over at [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms645540%28VS.85%29.aspx this MSDN page]. To add a key, simply append its hex value. Even though there are hex values for mouse buttons listed on that page, they will not work!

You actually don't need a space between the hex values, but it makes it easier to read. Removing all the keys makes it impossible to alt-drag windows, but you can still use `HookWindows`.

= Common keys =

I'm listing some common keys here.

|| *Key*              || *Hex value* ||
|| Left Alt Key       || A4 ||
|| Right Alt Key      || A5 ||
|| Left Windows Key   || 5B ||
|| Right Windows Key  || 5C ||

Write a comment if you think I have missed a common key.

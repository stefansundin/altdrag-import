= Introduction =

This is a list of features I want to implement. Feel free to add suggestions in the comments.

= Version 1.0 =
I want to finish this before I release 1.0:
  * `HookWindows (ExperimentalFeatures)`:
    * ~~support resizing~~ - Done in time for version 0.8.
    * support 64-bit processes
  * Alt shouldn't focus the menu

= Other stuff =
I also want to take care of this:
  * Be able to resize troublesome windows such as PuTTY.
  * Be able to drag and resize windows that have problems right now, such as Steam and Winamp.
  * Be able to detect if a window is partially overlapped by other windows and only stick to the visible borders.

If you know of more programs that have problems, please let me I know in the comments.

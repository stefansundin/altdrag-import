*AltDrag does not work in VirtualBox when using Linux as a host OS. Why?*
  * AltDrag does not work since your window manager is intercepting the alt keypress so you can move the VirtualBox window. You can reassign the hotkey for AltDrag as a workaround. For more information, read issue 23.

*I can't resize PuTTY!! FIX IT PLZ!*
  * This is due to a combination of bugs that were present in both AltDrag and PuTTY. Since 0.9, you can resize PuTTY, but *only* if you are using a key other than Alt! If you want to use the Alt button, then you have to run [http://tartarus.org/~simon/putty-snapshots/x86/putty.exe a development version of PuTTY] (at least `r9045`). For more information, read issue 27.

*I can't drag or resize window X. Why?*
  * Some programs implement their own window handlers which may interfere with AltDrag (e.g. Winamp). The problem most likely lies with the program you are trying to drag. They did not expect that another program might want to move it and thus they didn't code for that scenario. If you encounter a program that is having troubles, I suggest that you send a bug report to its developers. If you still think the problem lies with AltDrag, please file a bug report.

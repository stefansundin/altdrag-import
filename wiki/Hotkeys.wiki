= Introduction =

You can use the configuration window to easily enable the Alt keys, the Windows keys and the Ctrl keys. For other keys, you have to manually edit `AltDrag.ini`.

Configuring the `Hotkeys` option in the ini file is not easy. You have to specify the hex values that represent the keys on the keyboard.

You can find these hex values over at [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms645540%28VS.85%29.aspx this MSDN page]. To add a key, simply append its hex value to the list. Even though there are hex values for mouse buttons listed on that page, they will not work!

You actually don't need a space between the hex values, but it makes it easier to read. Removing all the keys makes it impossible to alt-drag windows, but you can still use `HookWindows`.

Some have requested the ability to only use the mouse to drag windows. I will consider this.

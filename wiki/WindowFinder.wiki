!WindowFinder is a tool I've made to help people blacklist windows. Since the blacklist can identify a window based the class name, which is used internally in Windows and normally not visible anywhere, it seemed appropriate to make a helper tool. With !WindowFinder you can just click the window you are interested in, and it will pop up with the class name of that window. If you pressed a child window or a component of the window, it will also give you information about them.

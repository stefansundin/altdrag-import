= AltDrag.exe =

AltDrag has historically only had one command line option; `-hide`. With the release of 1.0b2, several new options were added. Please note that all options are case-sensitive.

|| *Short option* || *Long option* || *Explanation* ||
|| `-h`           || `-hide`       || Do not add tray icon, hide it if already running. ||
|| `-q`           || `-quiet`      || Do nothing if already running (i.e. do not open configuration window or refresh settings). ||
|| `-e`           || `-elevate`    || Request elevation to administrator privileges when run. ||
|| `-c [n]`       || `-config [n]` || Open the configuration window (optionally go to page number `n`). ||

= Installer =

The installer accepts a few options. It has been designed to be able to run silently, which means it should be easy to deploy in large networks.

|| *Option*           || *Explanation* ||
|| `/S`               || Run silently. The installer will not check for updates. ||
|| `/L=fr-FR`         || Use supplied language. ||
|| `/D=C:\installdir` || Set destination directory. ||

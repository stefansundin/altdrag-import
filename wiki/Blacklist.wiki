= Introduction =

The blacklist is a new feature in AltDrag 0.5. There are two blacklists in AltDrag, the first determines which windows should be ignored when you attempt to drag them, and the other one determines which windows should be ignored by the sticky behavior (referred to as the "sticky blacklist").

By default, the Alt+Tab window is blacklisted, and the start button orb in Vista and a container window in Google Chrome is sticky blacklisted.

The Google Chrome container window seems to be a window that always follow the chrome window. Prior to 0.5 it was as though the Chrome window had a mind of its own when you tried to sticky drag it.

I realized that ability to customize the blacklists are important since we are all running different applications on our computers. I made the blacklist so that it can identify windows based on the title and the class name o. The class name is an identifier used internally in Windows, and is not normally visible. The blacklists are comma separated, and the entries themselves are in the format `title|classname`. Since the class name is not normally visible, I've made a tool called WindowFinder, which should be useful. If you omit either the title or the class name, then it will not include it whthe matching.

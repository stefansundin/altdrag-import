= Introduction =

This document explains how to compile AltDrag. There are two distinct parts that you have to compile separately, the 32-bit part and the 64-bit part.

Your first task is to download the AltDrag source code. You have to use an SVN client and check out "`http://altdrag.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/`".

= 32-bit part =

The 32-bit part is `AltDrag.exe` and `hooks.dll`. They can be easily compiled with [http://www.mingw.org/ MinGW]. Download and install MinGW, and then add `<MinGW path>\bin` to the PATH variable. After that you can compile the 32-bit part by running `build.bat`. It's convenient to run `build` in a terminal so you can see eventual error messages.

== Missing function definitions ==

MinGW is missing some definitions for the subclassing API, but I have included an updated library so the build script should be able to compile without errors. Mingw-w64 has updated lib files for both 32-bit and 64-bit compilation.

The functions definitions that are missing are "`DefSubclassProc@16`" and "`RemoveWindowSubclass@12`". If you want to update the library yourself, you have to [http://cygwin.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/src/winsup/w32api/lib/comctl32.def?cvsroot=src download comctl32.def], add the function definitions, and then run: `dlltool -k -d comctl32.def -D comctl32.dll -l libcomctl32.a`

= 64-bit part =

The 64-bit part is `HookWindows_x64.exe` and `hooks_x64.dll`. These files are only used if you enable HookWindows and are running x64. They need to be 64-bit so that they can hook into 64-bit processes. To compile them your best choice is using [http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/ mingw-w64]. Mingw-w64 works just as MinGW, except there are no installer and the binary files are prefixed.

The mingw-w64 file download section is a mess, but here's [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Automated%20Builds/mingw-w64-1.0-bin_i686-mingw_20091109.zip/download the 64-bit toolchain]. If you want, you can also download [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Automated%20Builds/mingw-w32-1.0-bin_i686-mingw_20091109.zip/download the 32-bit toolchain] and use mingw-w64 to compile the 32-bit part. Once you have the files in PATH, type "`build x64`" or "`build all x64`" to build.

`AltDrag.exe` and `hooks.dll` are not supposed to be compiled as 64-bit programs. You still need a 32-bit component to be able to use HookWindows for 32-bit processes, so because there is a prevalence of 32-bit programs that we use even on 64-bit Windows, it doesn't make sense to make AltDrag a 64-bit only program (yet).


= Installer =

To build the installer you need to download [http://www.scratchpaper.com/ NSIS Unicode] and put it in PATH as well, then run "`build all`" in the terminal to automatically build the installer.

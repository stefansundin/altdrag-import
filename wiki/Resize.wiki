The resize feature also exists in Linux. Use the middle or right mouse button when you have the alt button depressed. Think of the window as if it is divided into nine squares, and depending on where you press, you will resize it in a different way.

The resize feature has a little bonus that doesn't exist in Linux, if you press the middle of the window you will resize it in all directions.

= Introduction =

Okay, so you want to help? Great!

Before you start translating, I recommend that you take a look [https://code.google.com/p/altdrag/source/browse/#svn/trunk/localization in the source tree] and see if your language already has been translated, or if an out-of-date translation exists.

Since version 1.0, AltDrag can be translated via an ini file. Download the English [https://altdrag.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/localization/en-US/Translation.ini Translation.ini] file. Save it in the same directory as `AltDrag.exe`. Start translating the strings and launch AltDrag to try it out.

Some things to note:
  * Your new translation will replace the English translation.
  * You have to restart AltDrag between your changes.
  * AltDrag is fully unicode enabled, so all kinds of characters should be possible. Make sure to save the file with the correct encoding.
  * The sequence `\n` is converted to a newline.
  * The `&`-character specify that the next letter will be the shortcut to the control (e.g. the checkbox with the text "`&MDI support`" can be toggled with Alt+M). Note that for some reason you cannot use `&a` or `&A` for these shortcuts.


= The installer =

The installer has to be compiled to be translated. Download [https://altdrag.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/localization/en-US/installer.nsh installer.nsh] and translate the strings. Include it in your submission.


= Submit the translation =

Before you submit your translation, please double-check all your strings. Please update the top comments with your name and email.

Simply [mailto:recover89@gmail.com?subject=Translate%20AltDrag email the file to me] to submit the translation for inclusion in the next version.

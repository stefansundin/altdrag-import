Okay, so you want to help? Great!

I do however need *you* to understand some things:
  * Translating is a process. We will do several iterations to make sure your translation is of high quality.
  * You *must* keep your translation up to date in the future! If you do not respond to emails your translation will be removed!
  * If you submit your translation when I've just released a new version, it will not be released until the next version. And even then, I will probably need you to update it again. Strings are often finalized during betas/release candidates. I can notify you when I am ready to receive new translations, if you wish.
  * AltDrag is fully unicode enabled, so all kinds of characters should be possible. There might be some font problems though, but we'll solve that when we get there.

= That makes sense =

So you still want to help? Ok, let's do this!

This whole process starts by you [mailto:recover89@gmail.com?subject=Translate emailing me] and asking to translate AltDrag. I will then instruct you on how you proceed. It's as simple as that!

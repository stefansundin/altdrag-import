AltDrag
Made by Stefan Sundin

Drag windows with the mouse when pressing the alt key.
You can use the middle or right mouse button to resize windows.
If you press the shift key while you drag or resize, the window will stick to other windows.
You can double-click a window to maximize it.
You can double-click with the middle mouse button to roll-up windows.

You can edit more settings in AltDrag.ini:
* Enable experimental features to be able to use the shift key when normally moving windows.
* Enable AutoStick to make windows always stick without needing to press shift.
* Enable RMBMinimize to be able to minimize windows with the right mouse button.

Fullscreen windows, such as games, will not be dragged or resized.
If you experience lag when you move or resize windows, try disabling the mouse cursor switch in AltDrag.ini.
AltDrag will automatically check for updates. You can disable this in AltDrag.ini.

You can use -hide as a parameter to hide the tray icon.
